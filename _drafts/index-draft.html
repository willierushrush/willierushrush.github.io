  I'm Will, a PhD candidate in mathematics at <a href="http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/">Stony Brook University</a>, NY,
  specialising in complex analysis and holomorphic dynamics. This summer, I am teaching <a href="/teaching/mat342-summer20">MAT342</a> Complex Analysis.
</p>

<p>
  I was born and raised in the tropics of Indonesia, more precisely Jakarta, the big durian and unfortunately
  the fastest sinking city in the world. The teenage me grew up in the little red dot of Singapore and then I moved out to London, UK, where I spent my college/uni years.
  I earned my MSci degree in mathematics from <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/undergraduate/">Imperial College London</a> in 2019.
  Yes, I'm one of those people with no bachelors...

  On the <a href="/teaching/">teaching</a> section, you may find resources on courses I am currently teaching and have previously taught.
  Non-teaching mathematical resources can be found on <a href="/vita/">vita</a>. I also made a <a href="/blog/">blog</a> section
  to help myself transition from undergraduate level math. I aim to post regular content on mathematical ramblings I find fascinating.
  Most of it only require some complex analysis and topology, and all images, videos and gifs are my own unless otherwise stated.
  Any comments and feedback are welcome!
