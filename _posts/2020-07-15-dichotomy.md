Consider the family of quadratics $f_c(z) = z^2 + c$ parametrised by $c \in \mathbb{C}$. Recall from [here](/posts/2020/06/fatou_and_julia/) that the filled Julia set $K(f_c)$ of $f_c$ is the complement of the basin of infinity $B_{f_c}(\infty) = \\{ z \in \mathbb{C} | f_c^n(z) \to \infty \\}$, and the Julia set $J(f_c)$ is the boundary of $K(f_c)$. I mentioned on my [post](/posts/2020/07/mandelbrot-1/) on the Mandelbrot set is known that the Julia set $f_c$ is either connected or Cantor.

> **_Dichotomy Theorem:_** For any arbitrary $c \in \mathbb{C}$, either $K(f_c)$ contains $0$ and is connected, or $K(f_c)$ does not contain $0$ and is homeomorphic to the Cantor set.
