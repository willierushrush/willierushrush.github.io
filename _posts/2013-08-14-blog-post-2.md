Manifolds are automatically assumed to be 2nd countable by definition. Without this assumption, horrible topological objects like the long line, i.e. the concatenation of uncountably many copies of $[0,1)$, would be manifolds and paracompactness as well as the existence of partitions of unity would not come for granted.

Most introductory classes on Riemann surfaces or complex geometry will make a side remark that Riemann surfaces (without assuming 2nd countability) are always 2nd countable. This is quite a remarkable result and typically known as Rad√≥'s theorem [insert citation].

[insert bold] Rado's theorem
Every connected Riemann surface is second countable.

A Riemann surface is a connected one dimensional complex manifold, that is, a connected Hausdorff topological space that is locally homeomorphic to the unit disk $\mathbb{D} \subset \mathbb{C}$ and each transition map between two such overlapping charts is holomorphic.

Each Riemann surface $Y$ admits a holomorphic universal covering $p: Z \to Y$. Given a basepoint $x_0 \in Y$, the space $Z$ can be topologically defined as

$$
Z = \{ (x,[\gamma]) \; | \; x \in X, [\gamma] \text{ is a homotopy class of paths from } x_0 \text{ to }x \},
$$

and $p$ can be defined as a projection. Endow $Y$ with the Riemann surface structure by pullback via $p$. The uniformisation theorem guarantees that $Z$ is either biholomorphic to $\mathbb{D}$, $\mathbb{C}$ or the Riemann sphere $\mathbb{P}^1$. However, let's pretend we don't know this theorem yet since it is often proven using 2nd countability.

To prove Rado's theorem, it is sufficient to choose $Y$ to be some appropriate open subset of $X$ and construct non-constant holomorphic map $f : Z \to \mathbb{C}$. Indeed, since $f$ will be continuous and open, any countable basis of $\mathbb{C}$ can be pulled back via $f$ to a countable basis on $Z$, and then pushed forward via $p$ to a countable basis on $Y$. When $Y$ is nice enough, $X$ will also have a countable basis.

Remove two disjoint closed disks $D_1, D_2 \subset X$ and let $Y := X \backslash (D_1 \cup D_2)$. The problem is now reduced to finding a continuous map $h$ on $\bar{Y}$ such that $h$ is harmonic on $Y$, $h \equiv 0$ along $\partial D_1$ and $h \equiv 1$ along $\partial D_2$. When such a map $h$ exists, $\partial h$ ($\frac{\partial h}{\partial z} dz$ in local coordinates) is a holomorphic 1-form and automatically induces a map on the universal cover $Z$:

$$
f : Z \to \mathbb{C}, \quad (z,[\gamma]) \mapsto \int_\gamma \partial h.
$$

Since $h$ is non-constant, $f$ is also non-constant and holomorphic. Therefore, $Y$ is 2nd countable and so is $X$.
