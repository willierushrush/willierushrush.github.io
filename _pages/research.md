Lately, I have been keeping myself busy thinking of renormalization theory in holomorphic dynamics.

## Papers
  * _A priori bounds_ and degeneration for Herman rings with bounded type rotation number, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07794)   
  <sub> <sup> By adapting the near-degenerate regime, we prove that the boundaries of Herman rings of bounded type and of the simplest configuration are quasicircles with dilatation depending only on the degree and the rotation number. As a consequence, we show that these Herman rings always degenerate to a _Herman curve_, i.e. an invariant Jordan curve that is not contained in the closure of a rotation domain and on which the map is conjugate to a rigid rotation. This process enables us to construct the first general examples of rational maps having Herman curves of bounded type with arbitrary degree and combinatorics. In particular, they do not come from Blaschke products. We also demonstrate the existence of Renormalization Theory for Herman curves by constructing rescaled limits of the first return maps in the unicritical case. </sup> </sub>    

  * Combinatorial rigidity of Herman quasicircles with bounded type rotation number,

  <sub> <sup> An invariant quasicircle of a rational map is a _Herman quasicircle_ if it is conjugate to an irrational rotation and is not contained in the closure of any rotation domain. We prove combinatorial rigidity for rational maps having a Herman quasicircle of the simplest configuration and with bounded type rotation number. This implies that such Herman quasicircles always arise as genuine limits of degenerating Herman rings of the same rotation number. In the moduli space of rational maps, such Herman quasicircles of fixed rotation number can be continuously parametrized by their combinatorics. </sup> </sub>
