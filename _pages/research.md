Lately, I have been keeping myself busy thinking of renormalization theory in complex dynamics.

## Papers

  [arXiv:2302.07794](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07794)   
  * Rigidity of bounded type rotation quasicircles in holomorphic dynamics,   
  manuscript available upon request  
  * Hyperbolicity of renormaliation of unicritical Herman quasicircles,   
  in preparation
