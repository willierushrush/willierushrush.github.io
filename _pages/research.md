  * _A priori bounds_ and degeneration for Herman rings of bounded type rotation number,   
  in preparation (available upon request), [poster](https://www.msri.org/ckeditor_assets/attachments/2014/Poster-WRL.pdf)   
  <sub> <sup> By adapting the near-degenerate regime, we prove that the boundaries of Herman rings of bounded type rotation number and of the simplest configuration are quasicircles with dilatation depending only on the degree and the rotation number. As a consequence, we study the limits of degenerating Herman rings and construct the first general examples of rational maps with a non-trivial Herman curve, i.e. an invariant Jordan curve that is not contained in the closure of a rotation domain, does not come from a Blaschke product, and on which the map is conjugate to a rigid rotation. </sup> </sub>
