The uniformisation theorem states that every simply connected Riemann surface $X$ is conformally isomorphic to either the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$, the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ or the Riemann sphere $\mathbb{P}^1$. The classical proof relies heavily on techniques in potential theory including the Dirichlet principle and the Perron method. Rather than discussing the proof in detail, I am more interested in some of the immediate applications of the uniformisation theorem. This includes classification of Riemann surfaces in general.

Let's review a bit of covering space theory. Every connected Riemann surface $X$ admits a universal cover $p : Z \to X$, unique up to homeomorphism. The space $Z$ can be endowed with the pullback complex structure from $X$ such that $Z$ is a simply connected Riemann surface and $p$ is holomorphic. Consequently, with respect to this complex structure, the deck transformations of $p$ are automatically conformal automorphisms of $Z$ forming a subgroup $\Gamma$ of the group $\text{Aut}(Z)$ of all conformal automorphisms of $Z$. Surely, $\Gamma$ must be a discrete subgorup acting freely and properly discontinuously on $Z$. The goal for now is to see what $\Gamma$ looks like for every possible $Z$.

Suppose $Z$ is the Riemann sphere. A result in complex analysis states that every holomorphic self map of the Riemann sphere is a rational map $p(z)/q(z)$ where $p$ and $q$ are polynomials. Consequently, the group $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{P}^1)$ of conformal automorphisms of $\mathbb{P}^1$ has to be the group of Möbius transformations:
$$
\text{Aut}(\mathbb{P}^1) = \{ \frac{az+b}{cz+d} \vert a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{C}, ad-bc \neq 0 \}.
$$
A simply algebraic exercise should convince you that every Möbius transformation (that is not the identity) has a fixed point. As such, every subgroup $\Gamma$ of $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{P}^1)$ does not act freely on $\mathbb{P}^1$ unless $\Gamma$ is the trivial group consisting only of the identity map. Therefore, every connected Riemann surface $X$ which admits a universal cover $\mathbb{P}^1$ must be $\mathbb{P}^1$ itself!

Suppose $Z$ is the complex plane. Every conformal automorphism $f \in \text{Aut}(\mathbb{C})$ can be extended to a conformal automorphism of $\mathbb{P}^1$ by applying Riemann's theorem of removable singularities. The extension must have a fixed point at $\infty$ and the only Möbius transformations fixing $\infty$ are linear maps. In short,
$$
\text{Aut}(\mathbb{C}) = \{ az+b \vert a,b \in \mathbb{C}, a \neq 0 \}.
$$
Since we are only interested in subgroups acting freely, we only care about non-identity elements without fixed points, namely translations $\gamma_b(z) = z+b$ where $b\neq 0$. Another simple algebraic exercise should convince you that every translation is conjugate to each other, so then we may as well assume that $\Gamma$ contains the real unit translation $\gamma_1$. We shall consider different cases:
* $\Gamma$ is generated by $\gamma_1$. This produces a bi-infinite cylinder conformally isomorphic to the punctured plane $\mathbb{C}^\*$ by the map
$$
\mathbb{C}/\Gamma \to \mathbb{C}^\*, \quad z \mapsto e^{2\pi i z}.
$$
* $\Gamma$ contains some $\gamma_b$ where $b \not\in \mathbb{Z}$


> **_Classification_** Every connected Riemann surface $X$ is conformally isomorphic to a quotient $Z \backslash \Gamma$ where $Z$ is either $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{D}$, or $\mathbb{P}^1$, and $\Gamma$ is a discrete subgroup of the group $\text{Aut}(X)$ of conformal automorphisms of $X$.
