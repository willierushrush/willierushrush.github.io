My name is Willie Rush Lim. Born and raised in the tropics of Indonesia, educated in the little red dot of Singapore, and previously based in a bustling neighbourhood in London, I am currently a graduate student in mathematics at Stony Brook University, NY.

In this blog, you will find posts about mathematics, life in graduate school, and my personal experiences.
