Born and raised in the tropics of Indonesia, the teenage me grew up in the little red dot of Singapore and spent my college/uni years in London. I am currently a PhD candidate in mathematics at Stony Brook University, NY, specialising in complex analysis and holomorphic dynamics.

On my blog, I aim to post regular content on mathematical ramblings I personally find interesting.
