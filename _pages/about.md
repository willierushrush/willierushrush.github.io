Born and raised in the tropics of Indonesia, the teenage me grew up in the little red dot of Singapore and spent my college/uni years in London. I earned my masters degree in (pure) mathematics from [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/undergraduate/) in 2019. (Yes, I'm one of those people with no bachelors...) I am currently a PhD candidate in mathematics at Stony Brook University, NY, specialising in complex analysis and holomorphic dynamics.

On the [teaching](/teaching/) section, you may find resources on courses I am currently teaching and have previously taught. Non-teaching mathematical resources can be found on [vita](/vita/). On my [blog](/year-archive/), I aim to post regular content on mathematical ramblings I personally find fascinating. Most of it only require some complex analysis and topology. Any comments and feedback are welcome!
