    I'm Will, a fifth year PhD student in mathematics at <a href="http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/">Stony Brook University</a>, NY.
    I specialise in dynamical systems, in particular complex dynamics and renormalization theory. My advisor is <a href="http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/cards/dudkodzmitry.html/">Dzmitry Dudko</a>.

    I was born and raised in the tropics of Indonesia, more precisely Jakarta, the big durian and unfortunately
    the fastest sinking city in the world. The teenage me grew up in the little red dot of Singapore and then I moved out to London, UK, where I spent my college/uni years.
    I earned my MSci degree in pure mathematics from <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/undergraduate/">Imperial College London</a> in 2019.

    On the <a href="/teaching/">teaching</a> section, you may find resources on courses I am currently teaching and have previously taught.
    Papers and various graduate to research level mathematical stuff can be found on <a href="/research/">research</a> and <a href="/vita/">vita</a>. I also made a <a href="/blog/">blog</a> section
    to help myself transition from undergraduate level math. I aim to post regular content on mathematical ramblings I find fascinating.
