<p>
  Born and raised in the tropics of Indonesia, the teenage me grew up in the little red dot of Singapore and spent my college/uni years in London.
  I earned my masters degree in (pure) mathematics from <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/undergraduate/">Imperial College London</a> in 2019.
  (Yes, I'm one of those people with no bachelors...) I am currently a PhD candidate in mathematics at
  <a href="http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/">Stony Brook University</a>, NY, specialising in complex analysis and holomorphic dynamics.
</p>

<p>
  On the <a href="/teaching/">teaching</a> section, you may find resources on courses I am currently teaching and have previously taught.
  Non-teaching mathematical resources can be found on <a href="/vita/">vita</a>. I also made a <a href="/year-archive/">blog</a> section
  to help myself transition from undergraduate level math. I aim to post regular content on mathematical ramblings I find fascinating.
  Most of it only require some complex analysis and topology. Any comments and feedback are welcome!
