    Starting this fall, I will be a Tamarkin Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/math/">Brown University</a>. I specialise in dynamical systems, in particular one-dimensional holomorphic dynamics and renormalization theory.

    I was born and raised in the tropics of Indonesia, more precisely Jakarta, the big durian and unfortunately
    the fastest sinking city in the world. The teenage me grew up in the little red dot of Singapore.
    I earned my MSci degree in pure mathematics from <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/undergraduate/">Imperial College London</a> in 2019.
    Just recently, I completed my PhD in mathematics at <a href="http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/">Stony Brook University</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/cards/dudkodzmitry.html/">Dzmitry Dudko</a>.
